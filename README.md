## Background
Clash Royale is a real-time strategy mobile game developed by Supercell, released in 2016. Players collect and upgrade 
cards featuring troops, spells, and buildings, then use them in fast-paced battles against other players.

The core gameplay involves deploying cards strategically on a battlefield to destroy the opponent's towers while 
defending your own. Each card costs "elixir" that gradually regenerates during battle, requiring players to manage 
resources carefully. Matches last just a few minutes going from regular gameplay to double elixir to overtime to 
triple elixir.

Its free-to-play model with optional in-app purchases has made it one of the most successful mobile games, generating 
billions in revenue while maintaining a large, competitive player base worldwide.

## Motivation
While there are some existing examples of people building simple bots that are able to play Clash Royale 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gm-pnNieMU, https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/1aq5d7u/i_made_a_working_clash_royal_ai/)
I have seen not evidence of a Clash Royale bot that was able to progress beyond arena one or achieve any kind of 
high-level gameplay. 

My hope is that I will be able to create such a engine that can play Clash Royale at a high-level
and eventually reach 10K trophies!
